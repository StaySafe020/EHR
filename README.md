# Electronic Health Record (EHR) System

A web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system built with Rust and Python for the backend, AWS for database management, and HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (with React/Angular/Vue.js) for the frontend. This system aims to provide secure, scalable, and interoperable healthcare data management for clinicians and patients.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization
- **Secure Login**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for clinicians and patients.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different access levels (e.g., admin, doctor, nurse, patient) to restrict data visibility.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or equivalent.
- **Password Recovery**: Secure password reset via email or SMS with temporary tokens.

### Patient Data Management
- **Patient Profiles**: Store and manage demographics (name, age, gender, contact), medical history, allergies, medications, and vitals.
- **Record Creation/Editing**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for patient records, accessible by authorized users.
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search for patient records using indexed fields (e.g., name, ID).

### Clinical Workflow Support
- **Encounter Management**: Log patient visits, including symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
- **Order Entry**: Allow clinicians to order labs, imaging, or prescriptions with e-prescribing integration.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Basic rule-based alerts for drug interactions, allergies, or abnormal vitals.

### Patient Portal
- **Dashboard**: Display appointments, test results, and medications for patients.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments with calendar integration.
- **Secure Messaging**: Enable patient-provider communication with encryption.
- **Prescription Refills**: Allow patients to request refills, routed to clinicians for approval.

### Data Visualization
- **Charts and Graphs**: Display vitals, lab results, or trends (e.g., blood pressure over time) using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
- **Document Viewer**: Render PDFs or images (e.g., lab reports, X-rays) in the web app.

### Interoperability
- **FHIR Compliance**: Implement Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) APIs for data exchange with other systems.
- **Integration with External Systems**: Connect to labs, pharmacies, or imaging systems via APIs or HL7 standards.

### Security and Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest.
- **Audit Logging**: Track all user actions (e.g., who accessed what record) for compliance with HIPAA/GDPR.
- **Data Anonymization**: Ensure patient data is de-identified for analytics or research purposes.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular automated backups on AWS with disaster recovery mechanisms.

### Analytics and Reporting
- **Basic Analytics**: Generate reports on patient outcomes, appointment stats, or medication usage.
- **Export Functionality**: Allow data export in CSV/PDF formats for administrative use.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**:
  - **Rust**: Actix Web or Rocket for high-performance APIs and WebSocket support.
  - **Python**: FastAPI or Flask for rapid API development, with Pydantic for validation and Celery for asynchronous tasks.
- **Database (AWS)**:
  - **Amazon RDS**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data.
  - **Amazon DynamoDB**: For unstructured data (e.g., notes, logs).
  - **Amazon S3**: Storage for medical images and PDFs.
  - **Amazon ElastiCache**: Redis/Memcached for caching.
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies.
  - **Framework**: React (with Redux/Zustand), Angular (with RxJS), or Vue.js (with Vuex/Pinia).
  - **Styling**: Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **AWS ECS/EC2 or Fargate**: Containerized deployment.
  - **AWS CloudFront**: CDN for static assets.
  - **AWS Route 53**: DNS management.
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging.
- **Interoperability**: FHIR and HL7 standards for data exchange.
- **Security**: TLS, AES-256, OAuth 2.0, and compliance with HIPAA/GDPR.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Rust (via `rustup`), Python 3.8+, and Node.js.
